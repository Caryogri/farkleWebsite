# Grandpa Games - Designed for C S 260

Grandparents like to play games, but they don't like to do anything on a computer more complex than web browsing. This project hopes to solve these two issues: a website where they can play games with family. Simply have a more technologically savvy family member set up a room and have them join. Multiple players in different geographic locations will able to play the same game with only a web browser. While only one game will be available initially, the website will be designed so that more games can be added over time.
